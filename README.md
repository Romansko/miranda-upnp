# miranda-upnp
Python-based interactive UPnP client. Exported from [code.google.com/p/miranda-upnp](https://code.google.com/p/miranda-upnp) and patched for Python 3. (Tested with Python 3.12).

Miranda is a Python-based Universal Plug-N-Play client application designed to discover, query and interact with UPNP devices, particularly Internet Gateway Devices (aka, routers). It can be used to audit UPNP-enabled devices on a network for possible vulnerabilities. Some of its features include:

- Interactive shell with tab completion and command history
- Passive and active discovery of UPNP devices
- Customizable MSEARCH queries (query for specific devices/services)
- Full control over application settings such as IP addresses, ports and headers
- Simple enumeration of UPNP devices, services, actions and variables
- Correlation of input/output state variables with service actions
- Ability to send actions to UPNP services/devices
- Ability to save data to file for later analysis and collaboration
- Command logging
